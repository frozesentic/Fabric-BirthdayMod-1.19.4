## Installation
Minecraft Launcher
If you already have Fabric Loader installed, skip to step 4.

1. Download the [Fabric installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and run it.
2. Make sure the correct Minecraft version is selected, the path to your `.minecraft` folder is correct, and `create profile` is checked.
3. Click `Install` and then wait for the process to complete.
4. Open your `.minecraft` folder and create a folder within it called mods if it does not exist already.
5. Go to where you downloaded BirthdayMod and drag the jar file into the mods folder.
   Note: If the file appears to be a zip because of winrar, it isnâ€™t! just ignore that as it is still a jar
6. Open the Minecraft Launcher and select the Fabric profile.
7. Thats it, just click `Launch` to start up BirthdayMod.
